1.	Are the html tags and elements are same things?
NO, HTML elements and tags are a lot different. Let’s see what HTML elements and Tags actually are and their differences.
         HTML Tags: The starting and ending point parts of an HTML document    are HTML Tags, which start with < (less than) and end with >(greater than) angle bracket, and whatever is written inside the angle brackets are known as tags.
Both opening and closing tags must be there in order to function. There are also some self enclosing tags which require only one tag such as <hr>, <img>, <br> etc. The ending slash over here is optional.
Syntax: <p >...</p >

Example: 

<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 

<head> 
	<title>HTML Tags</title> 
	 
</head> 

<body> 
	<div class="container"> 
		<h2>HTML Tags</h2> 	 
		<p>The above line is due to <hr> tag</p> 
	</div> 
</body> 

</html>
HTML Elements: Elements in HTML enclose the content in between the tags. It consists of an expression or a structure. Its architecture consists of a start tag, content followed by an ending tag.
Syntax:
<b> This is the content. </b>

<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 

<head> 
	<title>HTML Elements</title> 
	<style> 
		.container { 
			height: 200px; 
			width: 350px; 
			background-color: green; 
			color: whitesmoke; 
			text-align: center; 
			font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; 
			margin: auto; 
		} 

		p { 
			font-size: 18px; 
		} 
	</style> 
</head> 

<body> 
	<div class="container"> 
		<h2>Gfg - HTML ELements</h2> 
		<p>Everything within tags is HTML Element</p> 
	</div> 
</body> 

</html>

Que:8:How is cell Padding different from cell Spacing?

Cellpadding:

Cellpadding specifies the space between the border of a table cell
and its contents (i.e) it defines the whitespace between the cell 
edge and the content of the cell.

Que:11:how can club two and three or more rows and columns in html?With Example?

Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is
The two most common display values are block and inline.

"Block-level Elements"
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

Example:
<p>Hello World</p>
<div>Hello World</div>

All the block-level elements in HTML:
<address>
<article>
<aside>
<blockquote>
<canvas>
<dd>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>
<fieldset>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<form>
<h1>-<h6>
<header>
<hr>
<li>
<main>
<nav>
<noscript>
<ol>
<p>
<pre>
<section>
<table>
<tfoot>
<ul>
<video>


"Inline Elements"
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.

Example:
<span>Hello World</span>

Here are the inline elements in HTML:

<b>
<bdo>
<big>
<br>
<button>
<cite>
<code>
<dfn>
<em>
<i>
<img>
